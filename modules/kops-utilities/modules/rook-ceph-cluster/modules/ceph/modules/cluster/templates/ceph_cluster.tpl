    # v12 is luminous, v13 is mimic, and v14 is nautilus.
    # RECOMMENDATION: In production, use a specific version tag instead of the general v13 flag, which pulls the latest release and could result in different
    # versions running within the cluster. See tags available at https://hub.docker.com/r/ceph/ceph/tags/.
